# GEV
GEV activation function for highly unbalanced data.

This code is used in *Introducing the GEV Activation Function for Highly Unbalanced Data to Develop COVID-19 Diagnostic Models, JBHI 2020.*
For binary classification, the GEV activation has been shown to significantly improve performance over the sigmoid activation when the data is highly unbalanced. 

## mGEV: Multiclass Extension
mGEV, the multiclass extension of the GEV activation function, has been accepted as a short paper at MIDL2021.
