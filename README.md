# GEV
GEV activation function for highly unbalanced data.

This code is used in *Introducing the GEV Activation Function for Highly Unbalanced Data to Develop COVID-19 Diagnostic Models, JBHI 2020.*

For binary classification, the GEV activation has been shown to significantly improve performance over the sigmoid activation when the data is highly unbalanced. 

Multiclass version will be added soon.

Current implementation is tested on:
- Python 3.8.2
- Tensorflow 2.2.0
- Keras-GPU 2.4.3
